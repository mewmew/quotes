* Science

> I am one of those who think like Nobel, that humanity will draw more good than evil from new discoveries.
>
> -- Marie Curie

> Humanity needs practical men, who get the most out of their work, and, without forgetting the general good, safeguard their own interests. But humanity also needs dreamers, for whom the disinterested development of an enterprise is so captivating that it becomes impossible for them to devote their care to their own material profit. Without doubt, these dreamers do not deserve wealth, because they do not desire it. Even so, a well-organized society should assure to such workers the efficient means of accomplishing their task, in a life freed from material care and freely consecrated to research.

* Freedom

> Freedom is always the freedom of dissenters.
>
> -- Rosa Luxemburg

> Freedom only for the supporters of the government, only for the members of a party - however numerous they may be - is no freedom at all. Freedom is always the freedom of the dissenter. Not because of the fanaticism of "justice", but rather because all that is instructive, wholesome, and purifying in political freedom depends on this essential characteristic, and its effects cease to work when "freedom" becomes a privilege.
>
> -- Rosa Luxemburg

* Confuse your enemy

> Admit nothing, deny everything and make counter-accusations.
