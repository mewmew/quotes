### You

> Find out who you are, and do it on purpose.
>
> -- Dolly Parton

### Orientation

> If you don't care where you are, then you ain't lost.

### Minimalism

> A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
>
> -- Antoine de Saint Exupery

> Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius - and a lot of courage - to move in the opposite direction.
>
> -- Albert Einstein

### Science

> I am one of those who think like Nobel, that humanity will draw more good than evil from new discoveries.
>
> -- Marie Curie

> Humanity needs practical men, who get the most out of their work, and, without forgetting the general good, safeguard their own interests. But humanity also needs dreamers, for whom the disinterested development of an enterprise is so captivating that it becomes impossible for them to devote their care to their own material profit. Without doubt, these dreamers do not deserve wealth, because they do not desire it. Even so, a well-organized society should assure to such workers the efficient means of accomplishing their task, in a life freed from material care and freely consecrated to research.

> -- Marie Curie

>
> -- Edgar Allan Poe

> The best things in life aren't things.
>
> -- Art Buchwald

> Flest saker när man dör vinner.

### Mistakes

> Some mistakes are too much fun to only make once.

### Time

> You cannot kill time without injuring eternity.

### Computers

> Why make things difficult, when it is possible to make them cryptic and totally illogical, with just a little bit more effort?

### Sad

> There is no sadder sight than a young pessimist.
>
> -- Mark Twain

### Freedom

> Freedom is always the freedom of dissenters.
>
> -- Rosa Luxemburg

> Freedom only for the supporters of the government, only for the members of a party - however numerous they may be - is no freedom at all. Freedom is always the freedom of the dissenter. Not because of the fanaticism of "justice", but rather because all that is instructive, wholesome, and purifying in political freedom depends on this essential characteristic, and its effects cease to work when "freedom" becomes a privilege.
>
> -- Rosa Luxemburg

### Confuse your enemy

> Admit nothing, deny everything and make counter-accusations.
